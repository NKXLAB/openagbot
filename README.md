 By 2050, world population is expected to rise to nine billion, but the amount of arable land meant to grow food will remain mostly the same as it stands today. As such, a 25% increase in productivity is mandated to support not just a growing populace.The agricultural industry is in transition.We are witnessing how robotics and autonomous systems can lead to transformational practices in areas such as manufacturing and mining, and we see that such technology will also soon transform agriculture.Agbot may ultimately help change the face of agriculture.  openagbot is an autonomous machine that's installed atop and around a small garden—in your backyard, on a rooftop, or inside a greenhouse or lab.OpenAgbot is a medium sized robotic development platform.Its large payload capacity and power systems accommodate an extensive variety of payloads, customized to meet research needs.  OpenAgbot is a open-source project .Many components can be made using 3D printers, and the software can be tweaked to add features—or improve those implemented by the company.so OpenAgbot could be just the beginning for this high-tech farming revolution.Because cost is very important in agriculture, we're trying to reduce price and build the optimal robot to do tasks.
